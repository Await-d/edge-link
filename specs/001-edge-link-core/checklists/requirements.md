# Specification Quality Checklist: Edge-Link Core System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

✅ **ALL CHECKLIST ITEMS PASSED**

The specification successfully maintains technology independence while providing clear, testable requirements. Key strengths:

1. **User Stories**: Four prioritized stories (P1-P4) that are independently testable and deliverable
2. **Edge Cases**: Comprehensive coverage of failure scenarios (network switching, control plane outages, NAT limitations, key compromise, etc.)
3. **Requirements**: 46 functional requirements organized by layer (Client, Control Plane, Management UI, Data Plane, Monitoring)
4. **Success Criteria**: 12 measurable outcomes focused on user experience and system behavior (not implementation)
5. **Assumptions**: Clearly documented technical and operational assumptions

## Notes

- The specification avoids implementation details while maintaining clarity through careful use of capability descriptions (e.g., "System MUST authenticate devices using pre-shared key" without specifying JWT, session tokens, or specific crypto libraries)
- Success criteria are framed from user/operator perspective (e.g., "Users can complete device registration in under 5 minutes" rather than "API responds in <200ms")
- All 46 functional requirements are testable through observable system behavior
- Edge cases provide clear guidance for resilience requirements without prescribing solutions
- The Assumptions section appropriately scopes MVP boundaries (IPv4 only, no external PKI, etc.)

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING (`/speckit.plan`)
